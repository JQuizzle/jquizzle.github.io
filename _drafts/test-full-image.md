This blog is finally up and running! At the moment, this is very much in an MVP state. MVP equals: writing a post, committing it, then pushing it up to Github where it serves and renders this Jekyll site.

Iâ€™ll be writing a detailed post regarding this workflow. In the meantime, I think there will just be random posts here and there.

This is an inline image. Let's get this 100% width!
