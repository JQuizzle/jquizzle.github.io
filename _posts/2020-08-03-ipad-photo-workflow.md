I think I’ve finally figured out how to use my iPad Pro to edit RAW DSLR images.

Here’s a quick rundown of the flow:

1. Take pics in RAW format.
- Pull the SD card into a USB-C reader.
- Plug the reader into the iPad.
- Open the *Files* app.
- Culling: 
	1. **Drag an image** to a selected tag. This is where I wish a shortcut for *Tags* was enabled. This would make the culling process a lot faster and easier. Instead, you either need to do the above process, or right click, select *Tags*, then select a color tag.
	- Delete all the untagged images. This is important step for me. I tend to keep all my photos around. So this forces me to declutter my images.
- Editing: 
	1. Import the images into **Lightroom CC**.
	- Edit the files as needed.
- Exporting:
	1. At the moment, I’m exporting everything to my **Camera Roll**. From here, it gets uploaded into my iCloud. Backups are uploading to Google Photos and Amazon Photos.

That’s my iPad editing process. For the longest time, I’ve wanted to use an iPad to manage this entire workflow. Now with Files support for external drives, along with a feature rich Lightroom CC app, I can.
