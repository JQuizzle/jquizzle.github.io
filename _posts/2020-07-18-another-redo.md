Welp. After a frustrating evening of playing around with someone else’s Jekyll theme, I’ve decided to rage quit and delete that repo. There was an issue that I couldn’t figure out where there needed to be at least 3 featured posts to display > 2 “regular” posts. I’m sure the logic was there, but I was too tired and frustrated to keep on digging.

So I am starting this blog fresh. Last night, I updated the repo and installed Bootstrap 4. Today, I created a base layout structure for the `index.md` and `post.html` files. Next up, adding more content and updating the design (potentially adding cards on the homepage for posts, and creating a `layouts/photo.html` layout!).

Lastly, I suppose the lesson here is, sometimes it’s best to rtfm fully and start fresh.
