After many many years of holding out, I've finally done it. I gone out and got myself a mechanical keyboard. More specifically, a [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard). 

Why now? I think my fingers were itching for a change. For the last 5 years, I've been typing on either an Apple Butterfly keyboard, or an Apple Magic Keyboard, I wanted a different experience. Plus, being able to nerd out and deep dive into the mechanical keyboard abyss seemed like fun.

### Initial impressions

1. **Finger Workouts**: My fingers are not used to the travel needed for a keypress.
1. The Noise: The switches are Gateron Browns. I thought they would be louder or have a sharper sound. I think I am longing for that sharper sound.
1. **RGB**: I do like the backlight. But I think white would have sufficed. However, since I have color options, I do enjoy changing the colors depending on what I'm doing. For example, gaming: red; trading: purple.
1. **Cross Platform**: I've been primarily using this at my Windows desktop. However, I do intend to use this with my work laptop. Also, given that I prefer Apple products to anything else, I've also changed the mapping of the `ALT` and `Windows` keys. Now in Windows, Copy/Paste are the same key combinations as the Mac. It's the little things that make the biggest difference.
1. **65% Layout**: I will need to get used to not have a function row.

### Next Steps

1. **Expand the Keycap Collection**: There are a lot of nice looking keyboards out there. I intend to update mine to be just as nice. I hear that PBT keycaps are supposed feel nice.
1. **Try Different Switches**: As I said above, I think I'm going to get some Cherry switches to try out.
