A lot has changed in the past two weeks. Quick update:

1. Baby’s almost 8 weeks old!
1. I’m back at work since last Monday.
1. I got new Cherry MX Blue switches today.

# Baby & Going Back to Work

It’s odd going back to work during a pandemic. I’m at work, but I’m also on the couch...next to baby. Next to baby feeding...while I’m on a conference call. It’s been quite the year.

Anyways, baby Bexley’s just about 8 weeks old. Her smiles are getting more pronounce and purposeful. Her coo’s are ever so cute. And her physical stature is slowly increasing.

# Mechanical Keyboard Switches

After getting the Keychron K6, I knew that I had to get new switches. So after buying a Cherry MX sampler set, I decided on getting the blue’s. These might just be a little to sharp for this 1 bedroom apartment. I think I’ll look into adding o-rings to them.

Oh, and I got some [SA-P Snow Cap](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-p-snow-cap-keyset-original/) Snow Cap keys. Shipped today. Arriving soon! Pics to come.
